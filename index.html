                            Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment
                            setup

                            React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using
                            React
                            and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access
                            your
                            platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
                            components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next
                            section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

                            React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                            JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This
                            section
                            can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

                        <p>
                            We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>components.</b>
                                    The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                                    approachable
                                    creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <b>JSX.</b>
                                    React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
                                    JavaScript
                                    like so: <span>&lt;Text&gt; Hello, I am your cat! &lt;/Text&gt;.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even
                                    more.
                                    Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are
                                    declaring a
                                    name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <span>&lt;Text&gt;</span>
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <b>props.</b>
                                    Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <b>state.</b>
                                    While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
                                    render,
                                    state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling
                                    data
                                    that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your
                                    components
                                    memory!

                        <p>
                            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText
                            prop
                            that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
                            that
                            takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
                            different
                            language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the
                            sentence
                            "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
